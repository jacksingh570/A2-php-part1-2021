The purpose of the assignment was to create to two tables in 
mySQL workbench, where I made an input table and a table consisting 
of various artists names. Once my database was completed I proceeded 
to work on my PHP where I use various commands to get the tables
to be functional with an active website.  

Sadly I lost my project and things did not work out as expected but nonetheless,
I learned more about php even  if my results say otherwise.
